### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 is a favorite since I found it satisfying to type down equations and utilize them with double data types to find the weight of something.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 is a favorite because I found programming if statements with logical operators rewarding. The if statements were confusing to type. But it was rewarding to finish.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 is a favorite. It was the first programming assignment I had to do. Understanding Cin and Cout was rewarding, it meant I could understand C++ through hard work.
